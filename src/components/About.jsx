                            The majority of my childhood was marked by the unique privilege of 
                            being a military kid. This kind of upbringing was extremely formative
                            in my understanding of the world and my place in it; I observed, 
                            experienced, and enjoyed numerous cultures of the world, became 
                            practiced in accepting change and adapting to my surroundings, and 
                            learned to differentiate between the things that are transient from 
                            those that are most important. As I approached adulthood, my family 
                            moved to the place I call home, Spokane, Washington. It is here that I
                            resolved to pursue ministry due to my growing love for Christ and the 
                            church. Consequently, I earned a bachelorâ€™s degree from Moody Bible 
                            Institute, and I am currently pursuing an M.Div. from The Southern 
                            Baptist Theological Seminary.
                        </p>
                        <p className='featured-text__paragraph'>
                            Alongside this pursuit, I also cultivated a strong desire to be active
                            and trained in another career field. For the next two and a half years,
                            I worked for a small construction company and succeeded in my daily 
                            toil. Little did I know, however, that this work would result in a 
                            significant back injury. With a career pivot on the horizon, I was 
                            determined to enter a field that I had a passion for and could excel 
                            in, a field that I could use to serve my community and the world. 
                            After much deliberation, I chose to enter into the tech field as a 
                            Full-Stack Web Developer. As a result, I spent the next year 
                            self-learning programming and earning a Full-Stack certification 
                            through Bloom Institute of Technology. Currently, I am glad to be using
                            my programming skills as a freelancer for ikTech, a company native to 
                            Spokane with a distinct focus on software development for nonprofit 
                            organizations.

                            Lastly, I am married to Teri Jo, my beloved bride of three years, and 
                            we have been astoundingly blessed with our son, Tobias. I thoroughly 
                            enjoy spending time together and with our families, serving the 
                            church, hiking and being outdoors, thinking deeply, and building my 
                            ancient and modern currency collection.
